## Introduction

This project leverages the Google YouTube Data API to scrape video information from YouTube. Using Pandas for data manipulation, NumPy for numerical operations, and Matplotlib for visualizations, you can analyze trends, statistics, and other insights from YouTube data.

## Prerequisites

To run this project, you will need:

- **Python 3.7 or higher**
- **Google API Key**: Obtain an API key from the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
- **Required Python Libraries**:
  - `google-api-python-client`
  - `pandas`
  - `numpy`
  - `matplotlib`

## Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/youtube-web-scraping.git
   cd youtube-web-scraping
   ```

2. **Create a Virtual Environment (Optional but recommended)**

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # On Windows use `venv\Scripts\activate`
   ```

3. **Install Required Libraries**

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. **Obtain and Set Up API Key**

   - Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/).
   - Create a new project or use an existing one.
   - Enable the YouTube Data API v3.
   - Create an API key and add it to your environment variables or a configuration file.

## Usage

1. **Configure API Key**

   Set your API key in the `config.py` file or export it as an environment variable:

   ```python
   # config.py
   API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   ```

   Or export it as an environment variable:

   ```bash
   export YOUTUBE_API_KEY='YOUR_API_KEY_HERE'
   ```

2. **Run the Scraper**

   Execute the main script to start scraping data:

   ```bash
   python scraper.py
   ```

   By default, the script will fetch video data based on predefined parameters. You can customize the search queries and parameters in `scraper.py`.

3. **Analyze and Visualize Data**

   After running the scraper, you can analyze and visualize the data using the provided Jupyter notebooks:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook analysis.ipynb
   ```

   This notebook contains examples of how to use Pandas, NumPy, and Matplotlib to perform data analysis and create visualizations.

## Project Structure

- **`scraper.py`**: Main script for scraping YouTube data using the Google API.
- **`config.py`**: Configuration file for API keys and settings.
- **`analysis.ipynb`**: Jupyter Notebook for analyzing and visualizing scraped data.
- **`requirements.txt`**: List of required Python libraries.
- **`README.md`**: This file.
